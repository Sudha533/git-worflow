# git-workflow
Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, track changes over time, and collaborate efficiently. It is particularly popular in software development but can be used for any project that involves file changes.

## Key Concepts
**Repository:**

1. A repository is like a project's folder. It contains all the project files and the entire history of their changes.
2. You can create a local repository on your computer and also have a remote repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

**Commit:**

1. A commit is like a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
2. You make a commit when you've made changes to your files that you want to save.
