# git-workflow
Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, track changes over time, and collaborate efficiently. It is particularly popular in software development but can be used for any project that involves file changes.

## Key Concepts
**Repository:**

1. A repository is like a project's folder. It contains all the project files and the entire history of their changes.
2. You can create a local repository on your computer and also have a remote repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

**Commit:**

1. A commit is like a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
2. You make a commit when you've made changes to your files that you want to save.

**Branch:**

1. A branch is a separate line of development. The default branch in most repositories is called main (formerly master).
2. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

**Merge:**

1. Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done when a feature is complete and ready to be integrated into the main branch.
   
**Clone:**
1. Cloning a repository means creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
   
**Pull:**
1. Pulling means fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.
   
**Push:**
1. Pushing means sending your commits from your local repository to a remote repository.
